# Foliage Rendering
This project is my approach to render thousands of grass objects at once while maintain a decent performance of 60 FPS in OpenGL.

# What I've learned
- How to implement GPU instancing with OpenGL
- Exploring general purpose computation with OpenGL compute shader
- How camera frustum culling optimization works
- How basic mesh level of details works
